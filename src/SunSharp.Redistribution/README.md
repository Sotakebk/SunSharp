# SunSharp.Redistribution

SunSharp is a C# wrapper and helper library for the [SunVox Library](https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/) - a small, fast and powerful modular synthesizer with a pattern-based sequencer (tracker).

This is an additional package, containing *SunVox* binaries, and the code to load them.
