# SunSharp
*[SunVox](https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/)* is a small, fast and powerful modular synthesizer with pattern-based sequencer (tracker). *SunVox Library* is the main part of the *SunVox* engine without a graphical interface.
*SunSharp* is a wrapper and helper library for *SunVox Library*, written in C#. The library contains a thin wrapper, allowing for comfortably making calls with C#-style methods and objects, as well as an intuitive object-oriented wrapper, managing a few more things for the user. Additionally, additional abstractions and mechanisms are provided to help implement dynamic music in games and other software.
Target SunVox version: 2.1.0.
